This repo is a fork of [Mi3-GPU](https://github.com/ahaldane/Mi3-GPU/), an algorithm to train a 2-site Potts model on aligned homologous protein sequences by maximum log-likelihood and MCMC sampling. This version is ready to install Mi3, train it and finally sample a MSA from it on a Kaggle (or Google Colab) machine. 

See [this Kaggle notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/enricoparisini/mi3-training-and-generation) for the installation and a typical pipeline, and the [covariation-fitness-misspecification](https://github.com/enricoparisini/covariation-fitness-misspecification) repo for additional tools to compute marginals, correlations and fitness scores from a trained model.
