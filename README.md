This repo is a fork of [Mi3-GPU](https://github.com/ahaldane/Mi3-GPU/), an algorithm to train a 2-site Potts model on aligned sequences of a given protein family by maximum log-likelihood. This version is ready to install Mi3, train it and finally sample a MSA from it on a Kaggle (or Google Colab) machine. See [this notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/enricoparisini/mi3-training-and-generation) for the installation and a typical pipeline.
